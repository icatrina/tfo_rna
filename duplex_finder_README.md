# duplex_finder
It identifies double stranded regions from the predicted secondary structures of a target RNA with a length between 6 and 12 nucleotides. 
Uses as input file an "sscount" file as described on the mfold webpage (http://www.unafold.org/mfold/documentation/mfold-documentation.php).
The output includes the percentage of purines in the idetified double straded regions.
The difference between duplex_finder and tfofinder is that the former does not differentiate between double stranded region formed without bulges on the 3' strand.
